This is a project I made for fun in April 2021.
The goal was to retrieve data from famous french travelling agencies (or marketplace) in order to rank all the travel for sale based on different elements like the price of the trip, the country, the number of stars and which company was proposing the trip (admitting that some travel company are offering low quality trips while other company are offering luxury trip)

The website scrapped are Promovacances and voyage Priv√© 

The scrapper was collecting html from Promovacances and then parse it.
For voyage Prive i've used their Json (that was available without access restriction) containing the integrity of the trip that are for sale.
